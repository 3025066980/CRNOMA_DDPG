These are the codes for the following paper

Z. Ding, R. Schober, and H. V. Poor, No-Pain No-Gain: DRL Assisted Optimization in Energy-Constrained CR-NOMA Networks, IEEE Trans. Communications, submitted. (a copy of this paper is included in this folder)


A good starting point to run the file 'two_user_case.py', which generates Fig. 1 in the paper. In order to simulate the case with fading, the file 'special_case.py' should be used, where Figs. 2, 3, and 4 in the paper can be generated. The file 'random_location_with_fading K.py' will take quite long time to run.
